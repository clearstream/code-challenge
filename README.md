# Laravel & Vue 3 Code Challenge
Churches have started to utilize QR codes more and more in their physical locations. We would like to build a new micro-application that allows a church to create a QR code that redirects to a URL of their choice. Churches want to be able to modify the URL at a later time. Additionally, churches want to be able to see some basic metrics around how often the QR code is scanned. Churches have also expressed an interest in being able to customize the QR code when creating it. We anticipate these QR codes could be scanned thousands of times every minute, so performance is very important.

As a summary, a user should be able to view QR codes that have been created, create new QR codes, edit and delete existing QR codes, and view metrics/metadata regarding QR codes.

_This project and scenario is hypothetical._
